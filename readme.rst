====================
Purpose
====================

GUI for the `booty <https://github.com/slightlynybbled/booty>`_ project.

====================
Installation
====================

In any environment, ``git clone`` this repository and execute ``python setup.py install`` or, more simply,
you may ``pip install bootycontrol``.

On windows environments, there is also an executable available within the
`releases <https://github.com/slightlynybbled/bootycontrol/releases>`_ directory.

====================
Running
====================

If the package is pip-installed, then the user may simply run ``bootycontrol`` from the command
line and the GUI will come up.

If the user is in a windows environment, then the user could also download the executable, which should
be runnable in the environment.  Note that it has only been tested on a recent version of windows 7, so
it may not run on other platforms (although I find no reason that it wouldn't).  If you find that it
doesn't run, then a contribution would be welcome.
